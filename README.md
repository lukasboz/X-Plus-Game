# X+ Game
This game is a modified version of tic-tac-toe against a CPU (bot). In this game, two participants (a human and the computer) alternate placing tiles on a board with n rows and n columns. 
To win, a player must strategically palce at least k tiles on the board to create either an X-shape or a +shape.
